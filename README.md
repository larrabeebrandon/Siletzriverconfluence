# Quiz Three: Generating Tiles with Qgis
### Brandon Larrabee
I selected a geographic location near Siletz Oregon. This is where I grew up so that is why I chose it. I selected the confluence of the North fork and South fork of the Siletz river. This river is very close to my heart. I selected the zoom levels of 16-18 and a really small area so that I could have multiple zoom levels but still fall into the category of uploading less than 100 files to Github.
My [Basemap](https://larrabeebrandon.github.io/Siletzriverconfluence/index.html) is shown by clicking the hot link.
